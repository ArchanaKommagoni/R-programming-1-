Explaination : The first boxplot shows how the "Frequency" values are spread out.The second boxplot represents the distribution of "Blood Pressure" levels.
The third boxplot compares the ratings from the first doctor, the second doctor, and the final decision about patient care.
Boxplots help us see the average values, range, and any unusual data points in the dataset.
The first histogram displays how often each "Frequency" value appears.The second histogram shows the spread of "Blood Pressure" values.
The third histogram combines and visualizes the distributions of the "First," "Second," and "Final Decision" ratings.
Histograms help us understand how the data is grouped, if there are common trends, and whether any values stand out as unusual.
