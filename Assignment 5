Define Matrices A and B = A <- matrix(1:100,nrow=10) B <- matrix(1:1000, nrow=10)
Determine the inverse of matrix A = if(det_A <-det(A)) { A_inv <- solve(A) cat("inverse of matrix A:\n") print(A_inv)} else {cat("Matrix A is singular, its determinant is zero.\n")}
Calculate the determinant of matrix B =
if (is.square <- nrow(B) == ncol(B)) { det_B <- det(B) cat("\nDeterminant of matrix B:", det_B, "\n") } else { cat("Matrix B is not square, its determinant cannot be calculated.\n") }
PROCEDURE:
Defining Matrices: Start by creating matrices A and B using the provided values. The matrix() function in R can be utilized to construct them.
Finding the Inverse of Matrix A: 
Use Râ€™s solve() function to calculate the inverse of matrix A. Before proceeding, ensure that the matrix is singular by checking that its determinant is not zero to avoid errors.
Determining the Determinant of Matrix B:
Since matrix B is not square, its determinant cannot be directly calculated.
Therefore, it is essential to first verify whether B is a square matrix before attempting to determine its determinant.
Displaying Results:
Finally, present the determinant of B and the inverse of A, along with any relevant observations regarding the squareness or singularity of the matrices.
