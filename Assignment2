Explaination: This code computes the average (mean) of a list of numbers.
The numbers are stored in a variable called assignment2, and they are grouped together using the c() function to create a collection that R can work with.
Then, a function named myMean is created. A function is a set of instructions that can be used multiple times.
The purpose of myMean is to find the mean of any group of numbers you provide.
Within the function, sum() adds up all the numbers, and length() counts how many numbers there are. 
Dividing the total by the count gives the average. The return() statement ensures the function gives back the result when it's called.
To find the mean of assignment2, the function is called by writing myMean(assignment2).
This sends the numbers from assignment2 into the function, which processes them and calculates the mean. 
The result is displayed using the print() function, which shows the mean (19.25) in the console.
