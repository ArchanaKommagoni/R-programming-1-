This data shows the Effect of Vitamin C Dosage and Supplement Type on Tooth Length.

Here in the markdown file, I added the R code chunks and also I tried to add Emphasis and Headers.

I added following R code chunks using ```{r}..............``` :

```{r}

data("Toothgrowth")

list(Toothgrowth)

``` 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

plot(Toothgrowth)

```



I added following Emphasis and Headers using **...** and ### respectively :

### **Plot for Effect of Vitamin C Dosage and Supplement Type on Tooth Length*

**...** gives me bold text and ### gives me header 3.



Then, I saved this markdown file by "Assignment 12.rmd".
