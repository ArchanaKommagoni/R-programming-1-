Q1.How do you tell what OO system (S3 vs. S4) an object is associated with? 
1-Answer- These methods can be used to determine if an object is associated with S3 or S4: To check if an object is not an S4 object, use is.object(x) & !isS4(x). To identify the object type, use sloop::otype(x). If it returns "S3", the object is linked to S3. While base objects do not have a class attribute, S3 objects do.
To check if an object is S3: Use is.object(x) & !isS4(x). If TRUE, it is likely an S3 object.
To check the object type directly: Use sloop::otype(x). If it returns "S3", the object is part of the S3 system.


Q2.How do you determine the base type (like integer or list) of an object?
2-Answer- To determine an object's base type, we can use typeof(x). 
Example: 
y <- list(a = 1, b = "text")
typeof(y)  # Returns base type as "list"


Q3.What is a generic function?
3-Answer-  A generic function provides a common interface for related functions, allowing methods to be executed based on the class of the input object. S3 generic functions are informal and use a special type of function to determine which method to invoke. In contrast, S4 generic functions support multiple dispatch and follow formal class definitions.


Q4.What are the main differences between S3 and S4?
4-Answer-
S3: 
1.Informal system.
2. No formal class definitions.
3. Methods belong to generic functions. 
4.Objects can belong to multiple classes.

S4:
1.Formal system. 
2.Has formal class definitions.
3. Methods are explicitly defined. 
4.Objects belong to a single class.


Q5.Examples of S3 and S4: 
5-Answer- Here are a few examples: 
Example for S3:
 # Create an S3 object
s <- list(name = "Archana", age = 23, GPA = 3.85)
class(s) <- "student"  # Assigning the S3 class "student" to the list

# Display the object
print(s)

# Check the class
class(s)  # Returns "student"

Example for S4:
# Create an S4 class definition
setClass("student", slots = c(name = "character", age = "numeric", GPA = "numeric"))

# Create an S4 object
s4 <- new("student", name = "Archana", age = 23, GPA = 3.85)

# Display the S4 object
s4

# Check the class
class(s4)  # Returns "student"
